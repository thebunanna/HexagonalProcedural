Most functions are working properly.
The problem with this submission lies with the bone intersection.
Mapping from mouse device coordinates was achieved, but the actual
intersection code is buggy at best and not working at worst.

To make up for this, custom keyframes were implemented. Each keyframe 
can be set to some amount of seconds using a slider below the canvas.

The video below shows its usage and all other features of this project.
